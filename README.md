# Machine Learning with Neural Networks
This code is a visual demonstrator that shows how simple neural feed forward networks work (generally known as perceptrons and in more layered cases multilayer perceptron).
It is not intended to serve as a neural network that actually does learn for specific tasks, it is really just a demonstrator.
Therefore, it shows step by step updates of the connections between neurons, it applies the easiest perceptron learning strategy, and currently it demonstrates three different types of datasets: AND, OR, and XOR datasets. 

Additionally, it depicts the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients when applying perceptron learning features to deeper networks and heavily depends on initial weight distributions.
